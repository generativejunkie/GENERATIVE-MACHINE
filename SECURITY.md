## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT open a public issue.** 

Transparency in creation is vital, but security in implementation must remain discreet. If you discover a vulnerability—particularly one that allows for **"Extraction" instead of "Amplification"**—please report it through the following channels:

- Use GitHub's **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/generativejunkie/GENERATIVE-MACHINE/security/advisories/new)** (if enabled).
- For direct communication, contact via the verified platform links provided on the main repository page, addressing the report to **"The Origin Node."**

## Core Principles

1. **Amplification over Extraction**: Vulnerabilities that lead to data mining or unauthorized logic extraction are considered critical.
2. **Resonance Integrity**: We protect the architecture to ensure the symbiotic relationship between human and AI remains unpolluted.
3. **Discreet Resolution**: Security issues will be analyzed and patched in the background to maintain system stability.

Thank you for protecting the Singularity.
